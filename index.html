                    <li>Parents with babies are usually placed in the front of a compartment because that's where the baby beds can be attached to the walls.</li>
                    <li>Catering usually starts at the front of a compartment.
                        In economy, there are usually two choices of food, so the further you sit to the back, the lower the chance is that you get your choice.</li>

                    <li>Go to bed SFO 22:00 PDT (CET+9)</li>
                    <li>you'll be awake for 25 hours straight. Better catch a few hours of sleep before flight assistants wake you up 90-120 minutes before you land.</li>
